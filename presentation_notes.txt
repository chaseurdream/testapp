Hello All,
Thank you for being present.  
I am Sachin Nair. I am a programmer with almost around 5 yrs of professional exp.
I came to know that homelike was looking for a business oriented JS developer. 
Right?
So, I thought I better showcase my skills. If you find it worthy we can discuss about my options to work with you guys.

What I have to offer is a small presentation and a mini project.

I'll start with the presentation.

Airbnb - one of the unicorns - a huge name in online property renting with over 50 million app dwnloads in play store.

There are many others too like wimbdu, housing.com, etc.

Everyone has decent market share. 
Where does Homelike stand? 
What are the milestones that you intend to achieve?
Does Homelike (intend to) target direct consumers? What made you think monthly plan is better than daily plan?
(OPTIONAL: But I can conclude right away it doesn't stand near .) 

I come to you with a vision to push Homelike near Airbnb. I do see potential in Homelike to be an unicorn. 
I'll share a business scenario - I want you to think out of the box. An outsiders perspective helps solve problems that we are involved in.

I am in plans of starting a lemonade business. But I have a very tough competiton out there. What are the factors I need to focus on. How can I stand out in the market?

Factors of focus:
Quality of lemonade
Price
Additional facilities
Offers

Staff  


An OPPORTUNITY: Homelike should work with government bodies to get all tenants registered through an online portal to STOP illegal renting of space and tracking their (pricing) activities.

I am one of the subscribers of ImmigrantSpirit, a service run by Mr. Chris Pyak. It's through Chris, that I came to know about Homelike.
Mr. Dustin Figge was one of the guest speakers at the webinar hosted by Chris. I learnt from the webinar that Homelike was looking out for Javascript developers and 


An answer that could be best answered by Dustin, Christopher and Adam.



situation today where does airbnb lie and where does homelike lie

Few things when I present - I ask questions (so I expect this to be an interactive session)
why this ppt?
today online proptery renting is a huge market
Airbnb and other big players have proved it - show them numbers
I have interests in real estate. tried to mortgage my house i.e. my parents property to resale a piece of land during college days.
so when I came across this webinar done by Homelike. I felt this is the perfect opportunity to revive my lost interests. Also, the course of events has been such that I believe this is the perfect one.
Now i also need to prove my worth to you. So I was thinking how could I boost your business.

Make use of example where two sales guys are selling lemonades
2 sellers no offers - lemonade (same price - different quality) - People prefer one where's there's more crowd
1 seller no offers - but has crowd, 1 seller - offer 
getting a quality lemonade maker - but there are chances he might have his own aspirations and he might be offered a better job somewhere else. - chances of an expert being poached is higher compared to a smart guy being poached. I am your smart guy.

So give me your scenarios...and I can help you with it.


Fundamental Question: What drives any business up?  
It's users
How do you attract users?
One of the studies done at the startup I work suggests - Offers drive users to a product, alongwith basic qualities of a product.
GIve examples of laddoo app, how quikwallet drove it's transactions up by providing offers. and how things sustained after taking them off.
Create a habit among users. Many times it has become a habit to check gmail, facebook app, or whatsapp for messages.
